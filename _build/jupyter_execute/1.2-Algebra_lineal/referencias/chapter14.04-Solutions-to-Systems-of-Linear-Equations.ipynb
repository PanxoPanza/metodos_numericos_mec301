    "Consider a system of linear equations in matrix form, $Ax=y$, where $A$ is an $m \\times n$ matrix. Recall that this means there are $m$ equations and $n$ unknowns in our system. A **solution** to a system of linear equations is an $x$ in ${\\mathbb{R}}^n$ that satisfies the matrix form equation. Depending on the values that populate $A$ and $y$, there are three distinct solution possibilities for $x$. Either there is no solution for $x$, or there is one, unique solution for $x$, or there are an infinite number of solutions for $x$. This fact is not shown in this text.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Case 1: There is no solution for $x$.** If ${rank}([A,y]) = {rank}(A) + 1$, then $y$ is\n",
    "linearly independent from the columns of $A$. Therefore $y$ is not in the range of $A$ and by definition, there cannot be an $x$ that satisfies the equation. Thus, comparing rank($[A,y]$) and rank($A$) provides an easy way to check if there are no solutions to a system of linear equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Case 2: There is a unique solution for $x$.** If ${rank}([A,y]) = {rank}(A)$, then $y$ can be written as a linear combination of the columns of $A$ and there is at least one solution for the matrix equation. For there to be only one solution, ${rank}(A) = n$ must also be true. In other words, the number of equations must be exactly equal to the number of unknowns.To see why this property results in a unique solution, consider the following three relationships between $m$ and $n: m < n, m = n$, and $m > n$. \n",
    "\n",
    "* For the case where $m < n$, ${rank}(A) = n$ cannot possibly be true because this means we have a \"fat\" matrix with fewer equations than unknowns. Thus, we do not need to consider this subcase.\n",
    "* When $m = n$ and ${rank}(A) = n$, then $A$ is square and invertible. Since the inverse of a matrix is unique, then the matrix equation $Ax = y$ can be solved by multiplying each side of the equation, on the left, by $A^{-1}$. This results in $A^{-1}Ax = A^{-1}y\\rightarrow Ix = A^{-1}y\\rightarrow x = A^{-1}y$, which gives the unique solution to the equation.\n",
    "* If $m > n$, then there are more equations than unknowns. However if ${rank}(A) = n$, then it is possible to choose $n$ equations (i.e., rows of A) such that if these equations are satisfied, then the remaining $m - n$ equations will be also satisfied. In other words, they are redundant. If the $m-n$ redundant equations are removed from the system, then the resulting system has an $A$ matrix that is $n \\times n$, and invertible. These facts are not proven in this text. The new system then has a unique solution, which is valid for the whole system.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Case 3: There is an infinite number of solutions for $x$.** If ${rank}([A, y]) = {rank}(A)$, then $y$ is in the range of $A$, and there is at least one solution for the matrix equation. However, if rank($A$) $<$ $n$, then there is an infinite number of solutions. The reason for this fact is as follows: although it is not shown here, if rank($A$) $<$ $n$, then there is at least one nonzero vector, $n$, that is in the null space of $A$ (Actually there are an infinite number of null space vectors under these conditions.). If $n$ is in the nullspace of $A$, then $An = 0$ by definition. Now let $x^{{\\ast}}$ be a solution to the matrix equation $Ax = y$; then necessarily, $Ax^{{\\ast}} = y$. However, $Ax^{{\\ast}} + An = y$ or $A(x^{{\\ast}} + n) = y$. Therefore, $x^{{\\ast}} + n$ is also a\n",
    "solution for $Ax = y$. In fact, since $A$ is a linear transformation, $x^{{\\ast}} + \\alpha n$ is a solution for any real number, $\\alpha$ (you should try to show this on your own). Since there are an infinite number of acceptable values for $\\alpha$, there are an infinite number of solutions for the matrix equation.\n",

But sometimes, we may have same set of equations but different sets of $y$ for different experiments. This is actually quite common in the real-world, that we have different experiment observations $y_a, y_b, y_c, ...$. Therefore, we have to solve $Ax=y_a$, $Ax=y_b$, ... many times, since every time the $[A, y]$ will change. This is really inefficient, is there a method that we only change the left side of $A$ but not the right hand $y$?

    "The above methods we introduced are all direct methods, in which we compute the solution with a finite number of operations. In this section, we will introduce a different class of methods, the **iterative methods**, or **indirect methods**. It starts with an initial guess of the solution and then repeatedly improve the solution until the change of the solution is below a threshold. In order to use this iterative process, we need first write the explicit form of a system of equations. If we have a system of linear equations:\n",

    "$$\n",

    "This is the basics of the iterative methods, we can assume initial values for all the $x$, and use it as $x^{(0)}$. In the first iteration, we can substitute $x^{(0)}$ into the right-hand side of the explicit equation above, and get the first iteration solution $x^{(1)}$. Thus, we can substitute $x^{(1)}$ into the equation and get substitute $x^{(2)}$. The iterations continue until the difference between $x^{(k)}$ and $x^{(k-1)}$ is smaller than some pre-defined value. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to have the iterative methods work, we do need specific condition for the solution to converge. A sufficient but not necessary condition of the convergence is the coefficient matrix $a$ is a **diagonally dominant**. This means that in each row of the matrix of coefficients $a$, the absolute value of the diagonal element is greater than the sum of the absolute values of the off-diagonal elements. If the coefficient matrix satisfy the condition, the iteration will converge to the solution. The solution might still converge even when this condition is not satisfied.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Gauss-Seidel Method\n",
    "The **Gauss-Seidel Method** is a specific iterative method, that is always using the latest estimated value for each elements in $x$. For example, we first assume the initial values for $x_2, x_3, \\cdots, x_n$ (except for $x_1$), and then we can calculate $x_1$. Using the calculated $x_1$ and the rest of the $x$ (except for $x_2$), we can calculate $x_2$. We can continue in the same manner and calculate all the elements in $x$. This will conclude the first iteration. We can see the unique part of Gauss-Seidel method is that we are always using the latest value for calculate the next value in $x$. We can then continue with the iterations until the value converges. Let us use this method to solve the same problem we just solved above. \n",
