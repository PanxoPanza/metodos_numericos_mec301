    "Before we introduce the systems of linear equations, let's first introduce some basics of linear algebra, which will be used to describe and solve the linear equations. We will just cover the very basics of it in this chapter, and you can explore more by reading a linear algebra book. \n",

    "## Sets\n",
    "\n",
    "We discussed the data structure - sets in chapter 2 before, here we will take a look of it from mathematics point of view using the mathematical languages. In mathematics, a **set** is a collection of objects. As we shown before, sets are usually denoted by braces {}. For example, $S = {orange, apple, banana}$ means \"S is the set containing 'orange', 'apple', and 'banana'\". \n",
    "\n",
    "The **empty set** is the set containing no objects and is typically denoted by empty braces such as $\\{\\}$ or by $\\emptyset$. Given two sets, $A$ and $B$, the **union** of $A$ and $B$ is denoted by $A \\cup B$ and equal to the set containing all the elements of $A$ and $B$. The **intersect** of $A$ and $B$ is denoted by $A \\cap B$ and equal to the set containing all the elements that belong to both $A$ and $B$. In set notation, a colon is used to mean **\"such that\"**. The usage of these terms will become apparent shortly. The symbol **$\\in$** is used to denote that an object is contained in a set. For example $a \\in A$ means \"$a$ is a member of $A$\" or \"$a$ is in $A$.\" A backslash, $\\backslash$, in set notation means **set minus**. So if $a\\in A$ then $A\\backslash a$ means \"$A$ minus the element, $a$.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several standard sets related to numbers, for example **natural numbers**, **whole numbers**, **integers**, **rational numbers**, **irrational numbers**, **real numbers**, and **complex numbers**. A description of each set and the symbol used to denote them is shown in the following table.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Set Name | Symbol  | Description  |\n",

    "## Vectors\n",
    "\n",
    "The set ${\\mathbb{R}}^n$ is the set of all $n$-tuples of real numbers. In set notation this is ${\\mathbb{R}}^n = \\{(x_1, x_2, x_3, \\cdots, x_n): x_1, x_2, x_3, \\cdots, x_n \\in {\\mathbb{R}}\\}$. For example, the set ${\\mathbb{R}}^3$ represents the set of real triples, $(x,y,z)$ coordinates, in three-dimensional space.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **vector** in ${\\mathbb{R}}^n$ is an $n$-tuple, or point, in ${\\mathbb{R}}^n$. Vectors can be written horizontally (i.e., with the elements of the vector next to each other) in a **row vector**, or vertically (i.e., with the elements of the vector on top of each other) in a **column vector**. If the context of a vector is ambiguous, it usually means the vector is a column vector. The $i$-th element of a vector, $v$, is denoted by $v_i$. The transpose of a column vector is a row vector of the same length, and the transpose of a row vector is a column vector. In mathematics, the transpose is denoted by a superscript $T$, or $v^T$. The **zero vector** is the vector in ${\\mathbb{R}}^n$ containing all zeros.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **norm** of a vector is a measure of its length. There are many ways of defining the length of a vector depending on the metric used (i.e., the distance formula chosen). The most common is called the $L_2$ norm, which is computed according to the distance formula you are probably familiar with from grade school. The **$L_2$ norm** of a vector $v$ is denoted by $\\Vert v \\Vert_{2}$ and $\\Vert v \\Vert_{2} = \\sqrt{\\sum_i v_i^2}$. This is sometimes also called Euclidian length and refers to the \"physical\" length of a vector in one-, two-, or three-dimensional space. The $L_1$ norm, or \"Manhattan Distance,\" is computed as $\\Vert v \\Vert_{1} = \\sum_i |v_i|$, and is named after the grid-like road structure in New York City. In general, the **p-norm**, $L_p$, of a vector is $\\Vert v \\Vert_{p} = \\sqrt[p]{(\\sum_i v_i^p)}$. The **$L_\\infty$ norm** is the $p$-norm, where $p = \\infty$. The $L_\\infty$ norm is written as $||v||_\\infty$ and it is equal to the maximum absolute value in $v$.\n",
